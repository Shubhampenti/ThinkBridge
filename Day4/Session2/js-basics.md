#  Session 2 – JavaScript Basics: Types & Control Flow

This session introduces **fundamental JavaScript concepts** such as variables, strings, arrays, loops, and conditionals.  
It includes **exercises with solutions** and runnable code snippets.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Variables**

Variables are used to **store data values**.  
They can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const` depending on scope and mutability.

- `var`, `let`, `const`
- Swapping variables without a temp
- Template literals

---

### 2. **Strings**

Strings represent **textual data enclosed in quotes**.  
They support operations like concatenation, slicing, searching, and case conversion.

- Length, concatenation
- Uppercase / lowercase
- Slice, indexOf
- Reversing a string
- Counting vowels with regex

---

### 3. **Arrays**

Arrays are **ordered collections of elements** (numbers, strings, objects, etc.).  
They provide powerful methods to manipulate and query data.

- `push`, `pop`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`
- `includes()`, `filter()`, `map()`
- Example: find even numbers, square numbers

---

### 4. **Loops**

Loops allow **repeating actions** until a condition is met.  
They are useful for traversing arrays or performing repeated tasks.

- `for...of`
- `while` and `do...while`
- `forEach`

---

### 5. **Conditionals**

Conditionals enable **decision-making in code**.  
They execute different code blocks depending on whether conditions are true or false.

- `if/else` → check even/odd
- Ternary operator
- `switch` → weekdays & weekend check
- Grading system

## Example Outputs

Variables -> { x: 5, y: 10, Name: 'Shubham' }
After swap -> { x: 10, y: 5 }
Hello, Shubham. x is 10 and y is 5.
Length of text1: 10
Squares -> [ 1, 4, 9 ]
Count is: 1
7 is Odd
Voting eligibility: Yes, you can vote
dayType('Sunday') -> Weekend
grade(85) -> B
weekdayName(3) -> Wednesday
