# Day 3 – Emmet, Snippets, Forms & Flexbox

Summary of **Emmet in VS Code**, **HTML Forms + Accessibility**, **CSS Fundamentals**, and **Flexbox Layout**.

---

## Session 1 – Emmet & Snippets

- Emmet expands abbreviations like `ul>li*3>a{Link $}` → full HTML.
- Saves time, reduces typos, improves workflow (built-in in VS Code).
- Custom Snippets: add to `html.json`, trigger with prefix (e.g., `navdemo`).
- Example expands into responsive navbar boilerplate.
- Debugging in VS Code: breakpoints, F5 run, F10 step over, F11 step in.

---

## Session 2 – HTML Forms + Accessibility

- Built signup form with semantic tags: `fieldset`, `legend`, `label`.
- Used attributes: `required`, `pattern`, `type`, `minlength`.
- Added ARIA (`aria-describedby`) for phone input help text.
- Fully keyboard navigable (Tab/Enter/Space).
- Lighthouse accessibility audit → score **100/100**.

---

## Session 3 – CSS Fundamentals

- Practiced **selectors**: class `.intro`, id `#unique`, attribute `[target]`.
- Explored **cascade, specificity, inheritance**.
- Box Model demo:
  ```css
  .zero { margin:0; padding:0; border:0; }
  Compared before/after states in DevTools screenshots.
  ```
