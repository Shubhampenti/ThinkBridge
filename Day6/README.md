# Day6 ‚Äì Keywords Explorer Project

## Introduction

The **Keywords Explorer** project is an educational web app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps learners quickly explore the most important keywords in each language, understand their purpose, and see practical examples in action.

## Why We Use Keywords

Keywords are **reserved words** in programming and markup languages.  
They have predefined meanings and special roles that the browser or compiler understands.

- In **HTML**, keywords like `<head>`, `<body>`, `<p>` define the structure of a webpage.
- In **CSS**, keywords such as `color`, `margin`, and `flex` define styling and layout.
- In **JavaScript**, keywords like `let`, `if`, and `function` control logic and behavior.

üëâ Without keywords, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to instruct the browser to structure content, style elements, or add interactivity.  
They are the **building blocks** of any web application.

## Session 1 ‚Äì Basic HTML Layout

### Overview

In this session, I created the basic HTML structure of the **Keywords Explorer** app.

### Files

- `index.html`

### Concepts Covered

- HTML5 document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Semantic tags: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`
- Input and select elements (search bar & theme selector)

### Output

- A static page with header, sections for HTML/CSS/JS, and footer.
- No styling or interactivity yet.

## Session 2 ‚Äì Adding CSS Styles

### Overview

We added **style.css** to apply themes, layout, and visual design.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `style.css`

### Concepts Covered

- CSS variables for theming
- Grid layout for sections
- Styled header, footer, and keyword blocks

### Output

- A visually styled page with themes and layout, but no interactivity yet.

## Session 3 ‚Äì Adding JavaScript Functionality

### Overview

I introduced **script.js** to render keywords, handle search filtering, and switch themes.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `script.js`

### Concepts Covered

- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Rendering keyword groups dynamically
- Search filter implementation
- Theme switching with event listeners

### Output

- Fully functional app with search and theme switching, but unstyled (no CSS yet).

## Session 4 ‚Äì Full Integration

### Overview

I integrated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together for the first complete version.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

### Concepts Covered

- Connecting structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JS)
- Example toggle buttons to show/hide keyword examples

### Output

- Fully functional and styled **Keywords Explorer** app.

## Session 5 ‚Äì Final Touch

### Overview

I added the final touch to enhance user experience and completeness.

### Files

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

### Concepts Covered

- Responsive Design  
  Example: ‚ÄúThe layout adjusts automatically for desktop and mobile screens.‚Äù
- Page Scroll Reset  
  Example: ‚ÄúAfter refresh, the page automatically starts at the top instead of remembering the last scroll position.‚Äù

### Output

- Complete project with HTML, CSS, and JS.
