# Portfolio Site – CSS Fundamentals

## Objectives

- Apply CSS styles to the HTML portfolio page.
- Understand the cascade, inheritance, and specificity.
- practice layout basics using the CSS box model and typography.

---

## Tasks

- Here we have to reate `styles.css` and link it in `index.html`.
- Style header, nav, footer, and main sections.
- Here practice using classes, IDs, and inheritance.
- Use `normalize.css` (or another CSS reset) for consistent styling.

---

## Project Structure

- `index.html` → Semantic HTML structure (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- `styles.css` → Custom styles for layout, text, and sections.
- `normalize.css` → CSS reset for browser consistency.
- `README.MD` → Detail steps regarding project

---

## Deliverables

- A **styled portfolio basic page** committed and pushed to the repository.
