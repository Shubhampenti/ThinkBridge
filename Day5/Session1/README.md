# Session 1 – Review 

This session was a **review of the last 4 days** of learning web development basics.  
I revised **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** concepts with practical exercises.

---

## HTML

- Learned and practiced **semantic tags**:
  - `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`.
- Built a **portfolio website** with semantic structure.
- Validated the HTML code using **[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)** to ensure correctness and standards compliance.

---

## CSS

- Learned **Flexbox** for responsive layouts.
- Practiced **CSS Grid** for creating structured, multi-column layouts.
- Styled the portfolio page to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.

---

## JavaScript

- Learned **variables** (`var`, `let`, `const`).
- Worked with **strings** and basic operations.
- Explored **events**:
  - Adding event listeners.
  - Handling user interactions (like button clicks).

---

## Key Takeaways

- HTML → Gives **structure** using semantic tags.
- CSS → Provides **layout control** with Flexbox and Grid.
- JavaScript → Adds **interactivity** through events and variables.

Together, they form the **core foundation of web development**.
